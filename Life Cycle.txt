As service worker is an event-driven script, it has a short life span. It wakes up with events and runs only if it needs to process the event. 
Through Service Worker the developer can treat the network as enhancement, control caching of resources on a proper way. 
Control over the cached resources plays an important role in developing offline application, which is one of the key features of PWA. 
Via service worker the webpage is available even offline and with cached data loads faster even on a flaky network.
